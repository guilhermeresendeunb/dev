Use sections as direct children of `body`.

```jsx
<body>
  <Section>
    <Container>
      <Title>Section</Title>
      <SubTitle>
        A simple container to divide your page into <strong>sections</strong>, like the one you're currently reading
      </SubTitle>
    </Container>
  </Section>
</body>
```

You can use the modifiers `is-medium` and `is-large` to change the spacing.

```jsx
<body>
  <Section medium>
    <Container>
      <Title>Section</Title>
      <SubTitle>
        A simple container to divide your page into <strong>sections</strong>, like the one you're currently reading
      </SubTitle>
    </Container>
  </Section>
</body>
```

```jsx
<body>
  <Section large>
    <Container>
      <Title>Section</Title>
      <SubTitle>
        A simple container to divide your page into <strong>sections</strong>, like the one you're currently reading
      </SubTitle>
    </Container>
  </Section>
</body>
```
